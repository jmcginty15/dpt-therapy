Trey had no issue taking her on and getting to work with her. The amount of progress she has made in the last few weeks is just AMAZING!!! The front office lady is phenomenal, I called with my concerns and was very pleasantly taken care of with the utmost respect and my daughter was in the next day which was even better because at the other place we were going it was always a bother to them. Not here, they are in it for the right reason! Helping and healing and personable. Highly recommend Trey and his entire staff, still home town feel and amazing amazing results, my daughter can now walk and without pain. Thank you so much to the entire staff!",
